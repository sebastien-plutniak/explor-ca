# explor (Correspondance Analysis)

This forked version of the [explor](https://github.com/juba/explor) R package by Julien Barnier has been modified to:

* run and explore Correspondance Analysis
* input data through URL parameter
* be executed on a R Shiny server

This version is intended to work with the [archeoViz](https://github.com/sebastien-plutniak/archeoviz) application / R package for archaeological data visualisation and analysis.
